# About
ThreatBite is a global reputation system used internally by [Optimatiq](https://optimatiq.com). It analyses incoming internet users and sends back a standardized score representing their trustworthiness. The program uses independent databases that collect up-to-date information about bad internet actors. Because it is an API service, it works in real-time, allowing you to act fast and block or keep an eye on suspicious user behavior.

10 requests per seconds are allowed, after reaching limit 429 HTTP status code is returned

### Configuration
Configuration is done via env variables or config.env file. All parameters are optional:
* `PORT`       - API listening port default 8080
* `DEBUG`      - values: false, true, 1, 0 or empty
* `AUTO_TLS`   - values: false, true, 1, 0 or empty, automatic access to certificates from Let's Encrypt

License keys for these external services will improve the quality of the results. It is highly recommended to set them.

* `MAXMIND_KEY` - obtained from https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/license-key   

Correct communication with the MTA server requires the following settings. Otherwise, the server may close the connection with the error: 
* `SMTP_HELLO` - the domain name or IP address of the SMTP client that will be provided as an argument to the HELO command
* `SMTP_FROM`  - MAIL FROM value passed to the SMTP server

IP/CIDR lists contain information about addresses used as proxy/VPN or other malicious activity. 
You can provide one or many sources separated by whitespace. 
The format of the data is straightforward, and each line contains one IP or CIDR addresses.
Threadbite open-source version provides public sources that are limited in scope and might be outdated with no SLA. 
If you interested in curated and more accurate lists with SLA, please contact us at threatbite@optimatiq.com

* `PROXY_LIST` - URL or set of URLs separated by space, default: https://get.threatbite.com/public/proxy.txt
* `SPAM_LIST`  - URL or set of URLs separated by space, default: https://get.threatbite.com/public/spam.txt
* `VPN_LIST`   - URL or set of URLs separated by space, default: https://get.threatbite.com/public/vpn.txt
* `DC_LIST`    - URL or set of URLs separated by space, default: https://get.threatbite.com/public/dc-names.txt

### config.env file 
You can store your custom configuration in config.env. The format is defined as below:

```
DEBUG=true
PORT=443
AUTO_TLS=true
PROXY_LIST=https://provider1.com https://provider2.com
```

By default threatbite binary is looking for config.env file in the same directory, 
but you can use `-config` flag to change this and point to any file in a filesystem.

`./bin/threatbite -confg=/etc/threatbite/config.env`
